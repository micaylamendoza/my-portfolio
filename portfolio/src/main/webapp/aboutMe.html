        <p class="aboutMeParagraph">I'm a student at Fordham University majoring in New Media and Digital Design with a concentration in New Media and Commerce, and a minor in Computer Science. Combining my eye for design with my background in software has lead me to develop an interest in UX/UI design.
            <br><br>
            Growing up in the Silicon Valley, I was surrounded by the technology industry from a young age. Inspired by my environment and the various ways in which I saw people contribute to this field, I decided to pursue computer science, as I began my freshman year of college. I was immediately immersed in a whole new world of problem solving and innovation and I was eager to develop my coding skills as I was introduced to the fundamentals of programming. Although I was interested in coding, I craved something more creative, as many promised me the technology field would provide me. At the end of my freshman year, I completed a basic web development project in one of my classes and I realized the computer science field had a entire avenue by which I could utilize my creativity and artistic abilities. I explored how I could continue to pursue this newfound passion and discovered Fordham's New Media and Digital Design program.
            <br><br>
            As a student in this interdisciplinary program, I have continued to take classes in the computer science department, to explore development from a technical perspective, while also taking classes that allow me to explore development from an aesthetic and strategic perspective. To complement my programming classes, I have taken classes related to user experience and research, branding, digital marketing, and digital production. I have developed a unique skillset that has prepared me to pursue a career in UX/UI design and development, and I believe I will be an excellent addition to the design community.
